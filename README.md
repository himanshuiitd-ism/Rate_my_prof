# rate_my_prof

This repo contains a simple MVP for a site that scrapes faculty from `https://www.iitism.ac.in/all-faculty`, allows anonymous ratings, and provides a per-prof real-time chat using Socket.IO.

Folders:

- `backend/` — Express + Socket.IO + MongoDB (or in-memory for dev)
- `frontend/` — React (Vite) + socket.io-client

See `backend/README.md` for backend-specific notes.
